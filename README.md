# How to make a passive income?
## Some details

This is simple project to build and deploy a [passive income blog](https://passive-income.today).

Actually it's a skeleton of the blog. I did want to use GitHub pages as free hosting and later to compare how it's fast/stable in comparing to AWS S3(Google Cloud and so on) and different hosting providers are offering similar price solutions.
But I did choose Gatsby.js as static CMS for the blog and it doesn't work with GitHub pages. I need to use Jekyll for that but the choice was made.

I wanted to move it back to private but now I have another idea: will a link from this repo have some weight from Google ranking system's perspective?

So I keep it public and let's see how much traffic can I get from this link.
